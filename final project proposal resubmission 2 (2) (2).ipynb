The folder has all 1533 images in the dataset. There are three more folders train/, val/ and test/ for training, validation and testing purposes respectively. Using this data for training a object detection model to identify and classify all the classes using the YOLOv7 model which is extensively used in autonomous vehicles and vehicle self-damage detection.\n",

    "In the rage of emerging automotive technologies, many real-world infotainment systems have been developed for automotive with the help of machine learning techniques. One such invention is autonomous cars, autonomous cars in the sense an automatic car which makes its own decision based on experience. As a diagnosis system in autonomous cars a self-damage identifying system is essential during any external disturbance. Our proposed system identiﬁes and classiﬁes the Dent and Scratch in the car using Object Detection Techniques. Dents and Scratches can be identiﬁed at any part of the car using the ML models which will be further used as a test case in Car Damage Detection system and can be employed in the car dashboard as an notiﬁcation during external disturbance.\n"

    "For starters, the system could revolutionize the way insurance companies assess car damage. Typically, this process is manual and can be time-consuming and subjective. With YOLOv7-based system, insurers could automate and standardize damage assessment. We upload pictures of the damaged car, and boom – the system provides a quick, detailed analysis of the damage. This would speed up claim processing times, enhance accuracy, and potentially even reduce fraud.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another cool application could be in the automotive resale market. The system could be used to assess used cars, providing potential buyers with an unbiased, comprehensive report of any existing damage. This transparency could build trust in the market and might even help in accurately pricing the cars. "
